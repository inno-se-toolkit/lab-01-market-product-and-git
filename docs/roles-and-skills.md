## My chosen role

**Chosen role: Backend Engineer**

I chose the Backend Engineer role because I am interested in building scalable server-side systems, APIs, and distributed services. This role aligns well with my interest in algorithms, system design, and working with data-intensive applications.

### Current skills
- Basic experience with backend development using Python and C++
- Understanding of client-server architecture and REST APIs
- Familiarity with relational databases and SQL basics
- Experience using Git for version control and teamwork

### Skills to improve
- Deeper understanding of distributed systems and high-load architectures
- Practical experience with cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP
- Performance optimization and scalability techniques
- Security best practices for backend services

## Personal reflection

After analyzing the job market, I see that my current skills partially match the requirements for a Backend Engineer role. I have a solid foundation in programming and backend fundamentals, but I need more hands-on experience with real-world systems, cloud platforms, and distributed architectures.

To close these gaps, I plan to:
- Build backend projects with REST APIs
- Practice system design and scalability concepts
- Learn cloud deployment and containerization tools
- Study backend security best practices

This task helped me better understand current industry expectations and define clear next steps for my professional development.
