# Task 3: My Tech Skills and the Market

**Time:** ~30-40 min

**Purpose:** Assess your current skills against market demands and plan your development.

## Context

You've explored a product's architecture and the roles needed to build it. Now it's time to look inward: where do you stand as a tech specialist? What skills do you have, and what should you develop?

## Steps

### 1. Create an Issue

Title: `[Task 3] Skills self-assessment`

### 2. Choose a Role

Pick **one role** that interests you most from those you researched in Task 2.

### 3. Explore roadmap.sh

1. Go to [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).
2. Find the roadmap for your chosen role (e.g., Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, DevOps).
3. Browse the roadmap and mentally note which items you know.

> [!TIP]
> You don't need to create an account. The roadmaps are publicly accessible.

### 4. Research Job Postings

1. Go to [HH.ru](https://hh.ru) or a similar job site.
2. Search for **5-7 job postings** for your chosen role.
3. For each posting, note:
   - Role title
   - Link
   - 3-5 key skills/requirements mentioned

### 5. Update `docs/roles-and-skills.md`

Add the following sections to your existing file:

#### `## My Chosen Role`

```markdown
### Role

<name of the role>

### Why This Role

<1-2 sentences on why this role interests you>

### Skills I Already Have
<!-- from roadmap.sh -->
- ...
- ...

### Skills I Clearly Lack
<!-- 4-5 important skills from roadmap.sh that you don't have yet -->
- ...
- ...
```

#### `## Job Market Snapshot`

```markdown
### Job Postings Reviewed

1. **<Role Title>** - [Link](<url>)
   - Skill 1
   - Skill 2
   - Skill 3

2. ...

### Skills That Appear in Multiple Postings
<!-- 3-10 skills that came up repeatedly -->
- ...

### Skills Specific to Single Postings
<!-- 2-5 niche skills that appeared only once -->
- ...
```

#### `## Personal Reflection`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Write this section **without** an LLM. This is your chance to think and arrive at useful conclusions.

Write 5-10 sentences reflecting on:

- Which role did I choose and why?
- How does my skillset compare to market demands?
- Which 1-2 key skills would I like to develop this semester? Why?
- What did I learn in this lab?
- If you used AI tools:
  - What did the tool do well?
  - What did it do poorly?

### 6. Complete the Git Workflow

1. Commit your changes.
2. Push and create a PR.
3. Request review from your partner.
4. Address feedback and merge.
