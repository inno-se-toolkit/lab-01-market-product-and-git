# Optional: Skill Development Strategy

**Time:** ~30-40 min

**Purpose:** Create a concrete, actionable plan to develop a skill you identified in Task 3.

## Context

In Task 3, you identified skills you lack. Identifying gaps is easy - actually closing them is hard. This task helps you create a realistic plan with accountability built in.

## Steps

### 1. Create an Issue

Title: `[Optional] Skill development strategy`

### 2. Choose One Skill

From your Task 3 analysis, pick **one skill** to focus on this semester.

Choose wisely:
- Something you genuinely want to learn
- Something achievable in one semester alongside other coursework
- Something with clear, accessible learning resources

### 3. Create `docs/skill-development-strategy.md`

#### `## The Skill`

```markdown
### What is this skill?

<3-5 sentences explaining the skill and why it matters>

### Why I chose it

<2-3 sentences on why this skill specifically>

### How I'll know I've developed it

<What does success look like? Be specific.>

Examples:
- "I can build a REST API from scratch without tutorials"
- "I can deploy an app to a cloud provider"
- "I can write unit tests for my code"
```

#### `## Learning Plan`

Create a week-by-week plan for the semester.

```markdown
### Resources I'll Use

1. **Primary resource:** <course, book, tutorial>
   - Link: <url>
   - Why: <why this resource>

2. **Secondary resource:** <documentation, videos, practice site>
   - Link: <url>
   - Why: <why this resource>

### Weekly Plan

| Week | Goal | Resource | Deliverable |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | <specific goal> | <which resource> | <what you'll produce> |
| 2 | <specific goal> | <which resource> | <what you'll produce> |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### This Week's Commitment

**Resource:** <specific resource to start with>
**Goal:** <what you'll complete by next week>
**Time commitment:** <hours per week>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your partner will review this for realism. Be honest about your available time.

#### `## Progress Tracking`

```markdown
### How I'll measure progress

<How will you know you're improving? Be specific.>

Examples:
- "Complete X exercises per week"
- "Build one small project per month"
- "Pass certification exam by end of semester"

### Accountability

<How will you stay on track?>

Examples:
- "Weekly check-in with partner"
- "Public learning log on GitHub"
- "Join a study group"

### Potential Obstacles

| Obstacle | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|
| <what might derail you> | <how you'll handle it> |
| <another obstacle> | <mitigation> |
```

### 4. Get Partner Review

Your partner should review for:
- Is the plan realistic given your course load?
- Are the weekly goals achievable?
- Is the "this week's commitment" specific enough?

### 5. Complete the Git Workflow

1. Commit your changes.
2. Push and create a PR.
3. Address partner feedback.
4. Merge.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] One skill chosen with clear justification
- [ ] Success criteria defined (how you'll know you've learned it)
- [ ] At least 2 learning resources identified with links
- [ ] Week-by-week plan for at least 8 weeks
- [ ] "This week's commitment" is specific and actionable
- [ ] Progress tracking method defined
- [ ] Potential obstacles identified with mitigations
- [ ] Partner reviewed for realism

## Reviewer Checklist

As a reviewer, assess:

- [ ] Is the skill choice realistic for one semester?
- [ ] Are the weekly goals achievable alongside other courses?
- [ ] Is "this week's commitment" specific enough to act on?
- [ ] Are the resources actually good? (Quick check the links)
- [ ] Are the obstacles realistic? Are mitigations practical?

**Give honest feedback:**
- If the plan seems too ambitious, say so
- If goals are vague, ask for specifics
- If you know better resources, suggest them

## Why This Matters

Most people fail at skill development because they:
1. Don't have a concrete plan
2. Don't track progress
3. Don't have accountability

This exercise addresses all three. The plan you create here can actually guide your semester.
