# Task 2: Tech Roles Involved in the Product

**Time:** ~20-25 min

**Purpose:** Understand what kinds of engineers build and operate the product you analyzed in Task 1.

## Context

Now that you understand the product's architecture, think about the people behind it. What roles are needed to build and maintain each component?

## Steps

### 1. Create an Issue

Title: `[Task 2] Roles and skills mapping`

### 2. Create `docs/roles-and-skills.md`

Create the file and add the following sections:

#### `## Components and Roles`

For each component you selected in Task 1, list the IT roles likely involved in building and maintaining it.

Use a nested list format:

```markdown
- **Mobile App**
  - Mobile Engineer (iOS/Android)
  - QA Engineer
  - UX Designer

- **Payment Service**
  - Backend Engineer
  - DevOps Engineer
  - Security Engineer
  - QA Engineer

- **Database Cluster**
  - Database Administrator (DBA)
  - Backend Engineer
  - Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

...
```

#### `## Roles and Responsibilities`

Select **5 roles** from your list above.

For each role, describe in 2-3 sentences:
- What do people in this role do?
- What are their main responsibilities?

You can use an LLM or search engine to research this.

#### `## Common Skills Across Roles`

Based on your research, list tech skills that appear across multiple roles.

Think about:
- Programming languages
- Tools and technologies
- Soft skills
- Methodologies

### 3. Complete the Git Workflow

1. Commit your changes.
2. Push and create a PR.
3. Request review from your partner.
4. Address feedback and merge.
